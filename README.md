## Features
This project uses Javascript in order to generate a password by selecting a random value from a set of arrays for a set length chosen by the user.
## Future Development
A path this project is headed is being able to allow more user input in the creation of the password so the password can be more personal and be used for personal accounts and be memorable to the user.
